# Protozftisreader [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/cta-sst-1m/protozfitsreader.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/cta-sst-1m/protozfitsreader)

## Installation:

We all use [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) and this package is tested
against Anaconda. You can [download anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download) for your system for free.

You do not have to use a [conda environment](https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html) to use this package. It cleanly installs and uninstalls with [pip](https://docs.python.org/3.6/installing/). If you plan to play around with different versions of this package your might want to use environments though.

### Linux (with anaconda)

    pip install https://github.com/cta-sst-1m/protozfitsreader/archive/v0.44.2.tar.gz

### OSX (with anaconda)

    pip install https://github.com/cta-sst-1m/protozfitsreader/archive/v0.44.2.tar.gz

To use it you'll have to find your `site-packages` folder, e.g. like this:

    dneise@lair:~$ python -m site
    sys.path = [
        '/home/dneise',
        '/home/dneise/anaconda3/lib/python36.zip',
        '/home/dneise/anaconda3/lib/python3.6',
        '/home/dneise/anaconda3/lib/python3.6/lib-dynload',
        '/home/dneise/anaconda3/lib/python3.6/site-packages',   <----- this one <-----
    ]

And then you'll have to (put it in your .bashrc for example)

    export DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=$DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH:/home/dneise/anaconda3/lib/python3.6/site-packages

### Miniconda & Faster installation?

If you use **Ana**conda this is not interesting for you, but if you use **Mini**conda,
then please read on.

You could just `pip install` this and it would use `pip` to install all the dependencies.
But `pip install <some package>` is sometimes much slower than `conda install <some package>`.

Two of the requirements of this package are `numpy` and `protobuf`.
We think installing them with `pip` is very slow, so we recommend to

    conda install numpy protobuf

before `pip`-installing this package for your convenience.

### To developers: No `pip --editable`

This package contains pre-build binaries, which (at the moment) are required to be installed
into your "site-packages" folder.
Developers like to install packages they are currently developing like this:

    pip install --editable .

Because then they can modify code and try it out without constant uninstall/install cycles.
Unfortunately this nice development workcycle is not possible at the moment.

I personally do:

    git clone https://github.com/cta-sst-1m/protozfitsreader
    pip install protozfitsreader
    # play around ... modify ...
    pip uninstall protozfitsreader --yes && pip install protozfitsreader
    # play around ... modify ...
    pip uninstall protozfitsreader --yes && pip install protozfitsreader
    # and so on

The uninstall/install takes 1..2sec ... so it is rather ok... not perfect though.


## Where does this come from?

The contents of this repo are based tar-balls thankfully generated by E. Lyard.
The [difference is explained](patching_so_files.md) on a seprate page.

## Usage example:

 ... to come soon.
